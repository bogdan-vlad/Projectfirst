                                <p>(Digital Single Lens Reflex)<br>A digital still image camera that uses a single lens reflex (SLR) mechanism. Most professional cameras have been single lens reflex, although analog film until digital SLRs emerged in the
                                    early 1990s. Following are the two major differences between DSLRs and standard digital cameras.</p>
                                <p>Removable Lenses<br> No single lens can handle every photographic requirement, and SLR cameras have always used removable lenses. A wide variety of lenses are available for each camera system, and many lenses that fit 35mm
                                    film SLRs also fit digital SLRs. However, the CCD or CMOS sensor in all but high-end digital SLRs is generally not as large as a 35mm frame, and 35mm lenses produce different focal lengths</p>
                                <p>Through the Lens<br> In an SLR, the photographer sees the image through the actual picture lens. To compose the picture, a mirror reflects the light from the lens to the viewfinder. When the picture is taken, the mirror
                                    momentarily flips out of the way to allow the light to pass through the lens diaphragm to the CCD or CMOS sensor (or to film in analog SLRs). Through-the-lens viewing enables precise manual focusing because tiny LCD
                                    screens do not have sufficient resolution. In addition, holding the viewfinder against the face helps steady it.</p>

                                <p>A digital camera that accepts different lenses. Also called a "mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera" (MILC), "hybrid camera" and "compact system camera" (CSC), the body is thinner than a digital SLR (DSLR) because it
                                    does not use a mechanical mirror to switch the scene between the optical viewfinder and image sensor. Mirrorless cameras are also called "mirrorless DSLRs" or "mirrorless SLRs" because they support multiple lenses like
                                    a single lens reflex camera and generally offer an optional viewfinder.</p>
                                <p>Introduced in 2008, mirrorless cameras became popular in the 2011 time frame and are becoming the choice of amateur photographers who want to migrate from point-and-shoot cameras. As these hybrids continue to increase sensor

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Probably the most important part of the camera.</p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/03-full.jpg" alt="">
                                <p>A camera lens (also known as photographic lens or photographic objective) is an optical lens or assembly of lenses used in conjunction with a camera body and mechanism to make images of objects either on photographic film
                                    or on other media capable of storing an image chemically or electronically.</p>
                                <p>There is no major difference in principle between a lens used for a still camera, a video camera, a telescope, a microscope, or other apparatus, but the detailed design and construction are different. A lens might be permanently
                                    fixed to a camera, or it might be interchangeable with lenses of different focal lengths, apertures, and other properties</p>
                                <p>While in principle a simple convex lens will suffice, in practice a compound lens made up of a number of optical lens elements is required to correct (as much as possible) the many optical aberrations that arise. Some aberrations
                                    will be present in any lens system. It is the job of the lens designer to balance these and produce a design that is suitable for photographic use and possibly mass production.</p>
                                <p>The two fundamental parameters of an optical lens are the focal length and the maximum aperture. The lens' focal length determines the magnification of the image projected onto the image plane, and the aperture the light
                                    intensity of that image. For a given photographic system the focal length determines the angle of view, short focal lengths giving a wider field of view than longer focal length lenses. A wider aperture, identified
                                    by a smaller f-number, allows using a faster shutter speed for the same exposure.</p>
                                <p>The maximum usable aperture of a lens is specified as the focal ratio or f-number, defined as the lens's focal length divided by the effective aperture (or entrance pupil), a dimensionless number. The lower the f-number,
                                    the higher light intensity at the focal plane. Larger apertures (smaller f-numbers) provide a much shallower depth of field than smaller apertures, other conditions being equal. Practical lens assemblies may also contain
                                    mechanisms to deal with measuring light, secondary apertures for flare reduction, and mechanisms to hold the aperture open until the instant of exposure to allow SLR cameras to focus with a brighter image with shallower
                                    depth of field, theoretically allowing better focus accuracy.</p>

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Understanding and what is it.</p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/04-full.jpg" alt="">
                                <p>Aperture is one of the three pillars of photography, with the other two being ISO and Shutter Speed. It might be the single most important camera setting in all of photography, simply because it affects so many different
                                    variables of an image. Aperture can add dimension to your photographs by blurring the background, and it also alters the exposure of your images by making them brighter or darker.</p>
                                <p>Simply put, aperture is a hole within a lens, through which light travels into the camera body. It is an easy concept to understand if you just think about how your eyes work. As you move between bright and dark environments,
                                    the iris in your eyes either expands or shrinks, controlling the size of your pupil — a hole that allows light to pass further into the eye. In photography, the “pupil” of your lens is called your aperture. You can
                                    shrink or enlarge the size of the aperture to allow more or less light to reach your camera sensor.</p>
                                <p>Aperture has several effects on your photographs. One of the most important is the brightness, or exposure, of your images. As aperture changes in size, it alters the overall amount of light that reaches your camera sensor
                                    — and therefore the brightness of your image. A large aperture (a wide opening) will pass a lot of light, resulting in a brighter photograph. A small aperture does just the opposite, making a photo darker.</p>
                                <p>The other critical effect of aperture is something known as depth of field. Depth of field is the amount of your photograph that appears sharp from front to back. Some images have a “thin” or “shallow” depth of field, where
                                    the background is completely out of focus. Other images have a “large” or “deep” depth of field, where both the foreground and background are sharp.</p>

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">The most creative of all.</p>
                                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/portfolio/05-full.jpg" alt="">
                                <p>Shutter Speed is one of the three pillars of photography, the other two being Aperture and ISO. Shutter speed is responsible for two particular things: changing the brightness of your photo, and creating dramatic effects
                                    by either freezing action or blurring motion.</p>
                                <p>Shutter speed exists because of something known as your camera shutter — which, simply put, is a curtain in front of the camera sensor that stays closed until the camera fires. When the camera fires, the shutter opens and
                                    fully exposes the camera sensor to the light that has passed through your lens. After the sensor is done collecting the light, the shutter closes immediately, stopping the light from hitting the sensor. The button that
                                    fires the camera is also called “shutter” or “shutter button,” because it triggers the shutter to open and close.</p>
                                <p>Shutter speed is the length of time your camera shutter is open, exposing light onto the camera sensor. Essentially, it’s how long your camera spends taking a photo. When you use a long shutter speed, you end up exposing
                                    your sensor for a significant period of time, which has a couple important effects on your photo.</p>
                                <p>The first big effect of shutter speed is motion blur. If your shutter speed is long, moving subjects in your photo will appear blurred along the direction of motion. This effect is used quite often in advertisements of
                                    cars and motorbikes, where a sense of speed and motion is communicated to the viewer by intentionally blurring the moving wheels.</p>
                                <p>Slow shutter speeds are also used to photograph the Milky Way or other objects at night, or in dim environments with a tripod. Landscape photographers may intentionally use long shutter speeds to create a sense of motion
                                    on rivers and waterfalls, while keeping everything else completely sharp.</p>
                                <p>On the other hand, shutter speed can also be used to do just the opposite — freeze motion. If you use an especially fast shutter speed, you can eliminate motion even from fast-moving objects, like birds in flight, or cars
                                    driving past. If you use a fast shutter speed while taking pictures of a water, each droplet will hang in the air completely sharp, which might not even be visible to our own eyes.</p>
                                <p>Shutter speeds are typically measured in fractions of a second, when they are under a second. For example 1/4 means a quarter of a second, while 1/250 means one two-hundred-and-fiftieth of a second (or four milliseconds).
                                    Most modern DSLRs and mirrorless cameras can handle shutter speeds of up to 1/4000th of a second, while some can handle much quicker speeds of 1/8000th of a second and faster. On the other hand, the longest available
                                    shutter speed on most DSLRs or mirrorless cameras is typically 30 seconds. You can use a longer shutter speed by using external remote triggers, if necessary.</p>

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">The sensor sentivity.</p>

                                <p>In very basic terms, ISO is the level of sensitivity of your camera to available light. The lower the ISO number, the less sensitive it is to the light, while a higher ISO number increases the sensitivity of your camera.
                                    The component within your camera that can change sensitivity is called “image sensor” or simply “sensor”. It is the most important (and most expensive) part of a camera and it is responsible for gathering light and
                                    transforming it into an image. With increased sensitivity, your camera sensor can capture images in low-light environments without having to use a flash. But higher sensitivity comes at an expense – it adds grain or
                                    “noise” to the pictures.</p>
                                <p>Every camera has something called “Base ISO”, which is typically the lowest ISO number of the sensor that can produce the highest image quality, without adding noise to the picture. Some older Nikon DSLRs and a number of
                                    other modern cameras such as the Fuji X-T2 have a base ISO of 200, whereas most modern Nikon and Canon digital cameras have a base ISO of 100. So, optimally, you should always try to stick to the base ISO to get the
                                    highest image quality. However, it is not always possible to do so, especially when working in low-light conditions.</p>
                                <p>Typically, ISO numbers start from 100-200 (Base ISO) and increment in value in geometric progression (power of two). So, the ISO sequence is: 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400 and etc. The important thing to understand,
                                    is that each step between the numbers effectively doubles the sensitivity of the sensor. So, ISO 200 is twice as sensitive as ISO 100, while ISO 400 is twice as sensitive as ISO 200. This makes ISO 400 four times as
                                    sensitive to light as ISO 100, and ISO 1600 sixteen times as sensitive to light as ISO 100, so on and so forth. What does it mean when a sensor is sixteen times as sensitive to light? It means that it needs sixteen
                                    times less time to capture an image!</p>

                                <p>Portrait photography or portraiture in photography is a photograph of a person or group of people that captures the personality of the subject by using effective lighting, backdrops, and poses. A portrait picture might
                                    be artistic, or it might be clinical, as part of a medical study. Frequently, portraits are commissioned for special occasions, such as weddings or school events. Portraits can serve many purposes, from usage on a personal
                                    Web site to display in the lobby of a business.</p>
                                <p>Lenses used in portrait photography are classically fast, medium telephoto lenses, though any lens may be used, depending on artistic purposes. See Canon EF Portrait Lenses for Canon lenses in this style; other manufacturers
                                    feature similar ranges. The first dedicated portrait lens was the Petzval lens developed in 1840 by Joseph Petzval. It had a relatively narrow field of view of 30 degrees, a focal length of 150mm, and a fast f-number
                                    in the f/3.3-3.7 range.</p>
                                <p>Speed-wise, fast lenses (wide aperture) are preferred, as these allow shallow depth of field (blurring the background), which helps isolate the subject from the background and focus attention on them. This is particularly
                                    useful in the field, where one does not have a back drop behind the subject, and the background may be distracting. The details of bokeh in the resulting blur are accordingly also a consideration; some lenses, in particular
                                    the "DC" (Defocus Control) types by Nikon, are designed to give the photographer control over this aspect, by providing an additional ring acting only on the quality of the bokeh, without influencing the foreground
                                    (hence, these are not soft-focus lenses). However, extremely wide apertures are less frequently used, because they have a very shallow depth of field and thus the subject's face will not be completely in focus. Thus,
                                    f/1.8 or f/2 is usually the maximum aperture used; f/1.2 or f/1.4 may be used, but the resulting defocus may be considered a special effect – the eyes will be sharp, but the ears and nose will be soft.</p>

                                <p>Landscape photography shows spaces within the world, sometimes vast and unending, but other times microscopic. Landscape photographs typically capture the presence of nature but can also focus on man-made features or disturbances
                                    of landscapes.</p>
                                <p>Landscape photography commonly involves daylight photography of natural features of land, sky and waters, at a distance—though some landscapes may involve subjects in a scenic setting nearby, even close-up, and sometimes
                                    at night. Photography of artificial scenery, such as farm fields, orchards, gardens and architecture, may be considered "landscape" photography as well. Even the presence of man-made structures (buildings, roads and
                                    bridges, etc.) or art (such as sculpture) may be considered "landscape" if presented in artistic settings or appearing (or photographed) in artistic style. Further, landscape photography is typically of relatively stationary
                                    subjects—arguably a form of "still life." This tends to simplify the task, as opposed to photography of kinetic or live subjects. However, landscape photography often overlaps the activity of wildlife photography and
                                    the two terms are used somewhat interchangeably; both wildlife and landscapes may be elements of the same picture or body of work.</p>
                                <p>For "wide open spaces," a wide-angle lens is generally the preferred lens, allowing a broad angle of view. However, medium-range to telephoto lenses can achieve satisfying imagery, as well, and can enable the capture of
                                    detailed scenery of smaller areas at greater distances. Telephoto lenses can also facilitate limited ranges of focus, to enable the photographer to emphasize a specific area, at a fairly specific distance, in sharp
                                    focus, with the foreground and background blurred (see: depth of field). A big difference between a wide-angles lens and a telephoto lens is the compression of the landscape; the wider the angle the more distance will
                                    appear between the foreground and background elements; however, a telephoto lens will make the same elements appear closer to each other. Other lenses that can help include the fisheye lens for extremely wide angles
                                    and dramatic effect, and the macro lens for extreme close-up work. While variable-range zoom lenses are widely used, some landscape photographers prefer fixed-range prime lenses to provide higher clarity and quality
                                    in the image.</p>

                                <p>Wildlife photography is a loosely-defined profession which demands a passion for nature and art. Wildlife photographers make a career of traveling to remote areas and taking pictures of wild animals and natural scenery.</p>
                                <p>Wildlife photography began as a hobby of safari hunters, in the early 1900s, who found photographs to be less violent and more permanent reminders of their adventures than the slaying and stuffing of a wild animal. Modern
                                    photographers often began as artists, biologists, or park rangers, and taught themselves the technical aspects of the field.</p>
                                <p>Classes in wildlife photography are offered at colleges and art schools around the world, and many organized safaris and expeditions also provide training and photographic opportunities. Wildlife photographs can be sold
                                    to greeting card companies, printed as posters, sold as stock photography, collected into a book, displayed in an art gallery, or sold to a magazine. Additionally, some wildlife photographers are hired full-time by
                                    nature magazines.</p>
                                <p>Wildlife photography is a demanding and competitive vocation. Traveling to isolated areas is expensive, as is the photographic equipment necessary for professional quality photos. The work itself is physically and mentally
                                    taxing, requiring patience and perfectionism. Because wild animals are wary of humans, wildlife photographers must use a hide to get close enough for a clear photograph. Hides are made of anything that conceals form
                                    and movement, such as a tiny tent with an opening for the camera, or a car with tinted windows.</p>
                                <p>Even with a hide, the photographer may have only several seconds in which to take the photo, due to the unpredictability of wild animals, making agility and patience necessary traits. Persistence is also useful. Obtaining
                                    special permission to visit national parks in restricted regions or after hours is often essential, although it can be very difficult to accomplish. In addition, the photographer must research the photographic site
                                    to understand local lighting conditions, weather, the habits of local</p>
